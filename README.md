# GO Application Development and Deployment 

   The Charles W. Davidson College of Engineering GO Program encourages students to invest in building their engineering careers. Primary objectives of the GO program include building a campus community, helping students build a professional network and helping students grow their technical skills. It encourages students to participate in career-preparedness activities by rewarding them with GO points. These include activities within and outside the campus. At the end of the semester, the GO points accumulated by a student can be cashed out for prizes.

   College of Engineering newsletter and a static webpage at https://engineering.sjsu.edu/go are the only means for students to get notified about events and dates related to the GO program. Students submit their activities and events through a Google form. The submissions are processed manually to calculate points for each student. Students do not have the ability to keep track of the points they have earned so far and the number of points they need to win the prizes they want. As a result, student participation in the GO program is low.

   In this project, we plan to build and deploy a robust software platform for the GO program. The software platform will provide mobile applications for Android and iOS phones, as well as a website through which students can access their profile. The website will also provide an interface for the GO program supervisor to publish content and send alerts. The apps and website will be supported by highly available and fault-tolerant backend infrastructure that can support thousands of concurrent users. Our aim is to develop a state-of-the-art student engagement platform that will set an example for other colleges and universities to follow.
